Thank you for your understanding.

## Introduction
This is a Pterodactyl Egg which allows you to have [Minecraft Console Client](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client) support.

## Requirements
This requires a [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) to be able to have host the [Pterodactly Panel](https://pterodactyl.io) or a host which allows you to edit the [Pterodactly Panel](https://pterodactyl.io) and add an egg to it.

## Notice
This is a simple notice reguarding:
- Server Support:
Some servers may not support [Minecraft Console Client](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client) or even [BerryPteroEgg](https://github.com/Berry-Studios/BerryPteroEgg) and some may require you to be [Whitelisted](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/whitelist) ( either your VPS IP or your whole UUID/name IP ) some may not even offer IP Whitelist for their players, we are not responsible for any ban that happens, you're responsible to ask the server administrators before joining.
- Host Support:
Some hosts may have been [IP Blacklisted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklist_(computing)) by [Mojang Studios](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) that's not something we can help you out there, and we do not encourage you to bypass it or find some loopholes, do not report this as a it being an issue and use another host instead.
